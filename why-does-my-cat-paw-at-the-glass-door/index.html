<p>In your case it sound to me like your cat is seeing their own reflection in the mirrors etc and thinks it is another cat and is trying to get to them.

She just stops what shes doing and scratches and scratches with both paws almost as if she has a compulsion to do so. Why Does My Cat Paw At Smooth Surfaces Is It Normal Feline Follower.</p>
