<p>If your cat just sits and stares at you its because youre eating something and youve forgotten that youre not allowed to eat alone. When your kitty finally sits in your lap or lets you hold her try to resist their cuteness and dont smother them with love because chances are your cat will find it overwhelming and try to escape once again. You are obliged to share food with your cat even if Nola will turn her nose at what youre offering. Good luck with turning your cat into a lap kitty. My Cat Sits Next To Me But Not On My Lap.</p>
