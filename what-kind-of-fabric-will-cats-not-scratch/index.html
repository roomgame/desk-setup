<p>Microfiber is a smooth soft fabric and those qualities are the opposite of what cats like in terms of textureCats like to scratch things that will help wear down their nails and this wont happen with microfiber microfiber also doesnt tend to snag or run like other upholstery materials. For a cat that loves to stretch upwards vertical scratching. Either that has been treated with a stain guard or designed to be naturally stain-resistant. In my experience cats are very unlikely to scratch or try to sharpen their nails on microfibers as its too soft. Oemrvymu6f L7m.</p>
