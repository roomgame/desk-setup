If this can be resolved it would be greatly appreciated!! Unfortunately, there is no way to stop the ir from powering on devices within its range, however, there is a way to prevent all consoles that are not your primary consoles from powering on or off your additional equipment like your tv or your sound systems.

Sound issues may develop due to temporary software glitches.</p>
