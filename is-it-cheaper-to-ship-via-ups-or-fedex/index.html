<p>In fact if you ship UPS with USPS or vice versa youre doing the company a favor. If youre looking for a price for ground shipping in the US and your parcel is no more than 66lbs USPS Parcel Select will be a slightly cheaper option than UPS Ground however the transit time is a bit longer. Usually USPS provides cheaper shipping options than both FedEx and UPS for lightweight packages up to 70 lbs. But if you use Easyship UPS will have a better rate.
