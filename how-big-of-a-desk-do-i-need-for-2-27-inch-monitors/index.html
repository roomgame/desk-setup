<p>But first of all, it depends on the size of the monitor as well. Most 27 inch monitors are about 24 inches wide x 17 inches tall. Our desks are available in a range of widths to suit your needs. If you are planning on running two monitors, you may need to pull out your measuring tape.</p>
<h3 id="what-size-monitor-do-i-need">What size monitor do i need?</h3><p>I have really only 49 inches of space for a desk and was wondering would that he enough to fit two 27 inches monitors, 2 phones, and a laptop? We chose to go really big with our desk width. Most 27 inch monitors are about 24 inches wide x 17 inches tall. Compared to a 24 inch display, the 27 inch display is 27% larger by area and 12% larger diagonally. Two 30″ monitors obviously require more space than 2 22″ monitors. The answer i gave before is valid regardless of the size of your monitors, going all the way up to two 27 inch monitors.</p>
